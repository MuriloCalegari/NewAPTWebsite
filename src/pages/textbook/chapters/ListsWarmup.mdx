# Warmup
>
For this exercise, you are given most of the code.
All that is left to do is fill in the blanks.

>
### SentenceLength
>
As part of analyzing readability you've been asked to compute the average sentence length of a list of sentences.
Each sentence is a white-space delimited string of words. The length of a sentence is the number of words in it.
See the examples for details.


<Grid style={{width: "100%"}}>
    <Row>
        <Col xs={24} md={12}>
            <Panel
                header={<b>Example 1</b>}
                className={"code-text-panel"}
            >
                sentenceList = ["the", "cat", "ate", "the", "dog"]

                returns 1.0

                There are five sentences, each is one word long, average is 1.0.
            </Panel>
        </Col>
        <Col xs={24} md={12}>
            <Panel
                header={<b>Example 2</b>}
                className={"code-text-panel"}
            >
                sentenceList = ["the cat ate", "the dog"]

                returns 2.5

                There are two sentences. One contains three words, the other contains two words. The average is 2.5.
            </Panel>
        </Col>
    </Row>
</Grid>

### Complete the code below

>

<CodeRunner
    javaScriptCode={`
export function average(sentencelist) {
  let wordsinsentence = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < sentencelist.length; i++) {
    const item = sentencelist[i];
    const wordsinitem = item.split(" ");
    const wordsinindividualsentence = wordsinitem.length;
    // MODIFY HERE ... WHAT IS NECESSARY TO HAPPEN TO wordsinsentence?
  }
  const numberofsentences = sentencelist.length;
  const result = wordsinsentence / numberofsentences;
  console.log(result);
  return result;
}

average(["the", "cat", "ate", "the", "dog"]);
`}
    testCode={`
import { average } from ".";

it("Example 1", () => {
  expect(average(["the", "cat", "ate", "the", "dog"])).toBe(1);
});
`}
/>
