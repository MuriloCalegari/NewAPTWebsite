# Warmup

> For this exercise, you are given most of the code.
> All that is left to do is fill in the blanks.

>

### SentenceLength

> As part of analyzing readability you've been asked to compute the average sentence length of a list of sentences.
> Each sentence is a white-space delimited string of words. <Highlight>The length of a sentence is the number of words in it.
> See the examples for details. </Highlight>

<Grid style={{width: "100%"}}>
    <Row>
        <Col xs={24} md={12}> 
            <Panel
                header={<b>Example 1</b>}
                className={"code-text-panel"}
            >
                sentenceList = ["the", "cat", "ate", "the", "dog"]

                returns 1.0
                There are five sentences, each is one word long, average is 1.0.
            </Panel>
        </Col>
        <Col xs={24} md={12}>
            <Panel
                header={<b>Example 2</b>}
                className={"code-text-panel"}
            >
                sentenceList = ["the cat ate", "the dog"]

                returns 2.5

                There are two sentences. One contains three words, the other contains two words. The average is 2.5.
            </Panel>
        </Col>
    </Row>

</Grid>

### Complete the code below

<CodeRunner
    javaScriptCode={`
// The function should return the average sentence length of the inputted sentenceList.

  for (let i = 0; i < sentencelist.length; i++) {
    const item = sentencelist[i];
    const wordsinitem = item.split(" ");
    const wordsinindividualsentence = wordsinitem.length;
    // MODIFY HERE ... WHAT IS NECESSARY TO HAPPEN TO wordsinsentence?
  }
  const numberofsentences = sentencelist.length;
  const result = wordsinsentence / numberofsentences;
  console.log(result);
