dictionary

:   A collection of key-value pairs that maps from keys to values. The
    keys can be any immutable type, and the values can be any type.

key

:   A data item that is *mapped to* a value in a dictionary. Keys are
    used to look up values in a dictionary.

key-value pair

:   One of the pairs of items in a dictionary. Values are looked up in a
    dictionary by key.

mapping type

:   A mapping type is a data type comprised of a collection of keys and
    associated values. Python\'s only built-in mapping type is the
    dictionary. Dictionaries implement the [associative
