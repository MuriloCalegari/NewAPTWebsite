# Introduction

Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating
identical or similar tasks without making errors is something that
computers do well and people do poorly.

Repeated execution of a sequence of statements is called **iteration**.
Because iteration is so common, Python provides several language
features to make it easier. We've already seen the `for` statement in a
previous chapter. This is a very common form of iteration in Python. In
this chapter we are going to look at the `while` statement --- another
way to have your program do iteration.

## Learning Goals

-   To understand indefinite iteration
-   To solve problems involving convergence

## Objectives

-   To apply the while loop for indefinite iteration
-   To be able to identify while loops that are likely to be infinite
    loops
