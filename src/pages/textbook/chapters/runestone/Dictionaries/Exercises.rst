    In order to get the last line to print "success", what should the value *x* (in the last line) be?

    .. sourcecode:: python

        d = { 'work': 'success', 'success': 'failure', 'failure': 'money', 'time': 'work', 'industry': 'time'}
        print d[d[x]]

    -   :(^time$)|('time')|("time"): Good Work!  The word time with quotes around it is better as it indicates that you understand that we were referring to a literal string value.
        :industry: It prints "work".
        :work: It prints "failure".
        :success: It prints "money".
        :.*: Incorrect, try again.

               Write a program that allows the user to enter a string.  It then prints a
               table of the letters of the alphabet in alphabetical order which occur in
               the string together with the number of times each letter occurs. Case should
               be ignored. A sample run of the program might look this this::

                   Please enter a sentence: ThiS is String with Upper and lower case Letters.
                   a  2

    Consider the following function:

    .. sourcecode:: python

        alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
        values = {}
        for i in range(len(alphabet)):
            values[alphabet[i]] = i+1;
        answer  = 0
        for c in s:
            answer += values[c]
        return answer

    When the ``foo()`` is called with the input "baa", what value does it return? (Write "error" if you think it would raise an error instead.)

    -   :4: Good Work!
        :error: The code is valid.
        :.*: Incorrect, try again. (*Hint:* Lookup value of each character of "baa" in ``values``.)
