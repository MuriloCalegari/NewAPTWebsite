### SentenceLength

As part of analyzing readability you've been asked to compute the average sentence length of a list of sentences. 
Each sentence is a white-space delimited string of words. The length of a sentence is the number of words in it.
See the examples for details.


Example 1

> sentenceList = ["the", "cat", "ate", "the", "dog"]
> 
>> returns 1.0
> 
>> There are five sentences, each is one word long, average is 1.0.

Example 2

>sentenceList = ["the cat ate", "the dog"]
>
>>returns 2.5
>
>>There are two sentences. One contains three words, the other contains two words. The average is 2.5.
